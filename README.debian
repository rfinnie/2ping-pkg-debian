2ping for Debian
================

This package includes a systemd service and a sysvinit initscript to
start a 2ping listener as a daemon, but they are not enabled by default.

To enable it on systemd, run:

    systemctl enable 2ping
    systemctl start 2ping

To enable it on sysvinit, edit /etc/default/2ping and set:

    TWOPINGD_RUN=yes

    /etc/init.d/2ping start
